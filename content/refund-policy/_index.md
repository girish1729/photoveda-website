# Refund policy


##Refunds

Subscription fees are non-refundable; except that you may cancel renewed
subscription by contacting Support within two (2) calendar days after
the renewal date and receive a full refund of the new subscription fees.


## REFUND POLICY

Photoveda is a browser-based editor product that provides a free
experience as well as the option to upgrade to an Annual or Monthly
Photoveda paid Plan to unlock tools within our editing experience. Because
we offer a free version of Photoveda to all users, we do not issue refunds
for subscriptions once you decide to upgrade to a paid Photoveda Plan.

## Cancellation

All subscriptions are renewed automatically until canceled. We make
cancelling easy and accessible. Photoveda customers can manage their
subscriptions and cancellations by going to their Workspace Settings.
Users who are unable to cancel their subscription through their
workspace settings must contact Photoveda's support team before the end of
the current billing cycle to avoid being charged for the next cycle. We
do not offer refunds to users who do not unsubscribe or request
assistance from Photoveda's support team to unsubscribe before the
subscription renewal date. If you do cancel before the renewal date, you
will continue to have access to all premium features of your respective
Plan on Photoveda until the end of the original billing cycle. Please note
that we do not send email payment reminders; Photoveda customers are
responsible for managing their subscriptions and cancelling on time;
failure to do so will not result in a refund. Following the cancellation
of a paid subscription Plan, your workspace will downgrade to a free
user workspace with free user limitations, including storage.

## Software Limitations

All free and paid Plan limitations are listed on our Pricing Page.
Please review these restrictions and test the product thoroughly before
making an informed decision to upgrade. We do not offer free trials.
Users who upgrade to a Photoveda paid Plan acknowledge the platform's
stated limitations. Failure to consider the stated restrictions and test
our product prior to upgrading will not result in a refund.

## Technical Issues

We're a one man operation and are working on addressing bugs and developing
new features as quickly as possible. If a technical issue occurs please
contact Photoveda's support team or select "Report a Problem" from the
"Help" icon within the project or workspace you are experiencing issues
in. Tools identified as 'Beta' or fully accessible in our free product
version are not eligible for a refund should a technical issue occur.
Typically, our technical support team members respond to Paid Plan users
with an update on their investigation within 24-48 business hours. Our
customer support operating hours are M - F 10am - 4pm PST. Photoveda
reserves the right to troubleshoot to resolve users' technical issues.
If we are unable to resolve your issue in a timely manner (2 business
days from our initial response - excludes automated messages) a credit
will be applied to your account (no refunds) in a prorated amount
determined on a case by case basis. Failure to notify us of a technical
issue will not result in a refund.

## Account Deletion

Photoveda customers who delete their Team Workspace or Account are not
eligible for a refund, as this deletes all user data to determine
whether a subscription was used or not. Without this data, our support
team cannot provide help with your subscription or past charges. If you
delete your account, your subscription will be canceled effective
immediately and you will not be eligible for a refund following the
deletion.

## Billing

Pricing and Plan availability may vary by location. If you believe that
Photoveda has billed you incorrectly, you must contact Photoveda's support
team by email no later than thirty (30) days after the billing date of
the charge in question to receive an adjustment or credit.

If you are on the Photoveda Pro Plan, you are billed per workspace
member's seat. When you add a member or multiple members to your team
workspace, you will be billed immediately for another seat or multiple
seats in your team for the remaining time of your billing cycle. Adding
a new member to an established Pro Plan will result in charges occurring
at the established billing cycle; there can only be one billing cycle
set in a team workspace for all members, whether it be monthly or
annually.

When filing a dispute with your financial institution your subscription
will be canceled effectively immediately and any remaining time on the
subscription will be forfeited regardless of the outcome of the dispute.
Subscriptions can not be reinstated after a dispute has been resolved.

## Changes to This Refund Policy

We may update our refund policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised
to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of
any changes by posting the new refund policy on this page. These changes
are effective immediately after they are posted on this page, and we
will update the “Effective Date” shown at the beginning of this policy.

We're a one man operation and really appreciate your business! Photoveda Plan payments allow us to operate and offer most of our tools for free. We're
constantly developing new tools and capabilities on the website which
you will have access to as a Pro subscriber.

## Contact Us

If for any reason you're unhappy with Photoveda, please let us know.
Contact us over email with a detailed account of what happened, and
we'll work with you to make sure you have the best experience possible.
