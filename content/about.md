##  How it started?

Started in 2023 Photoveda was created to process images with the comfort
of the browser. It is operated solo and fully bootstrapped. I am a
serial entrepreneur and this is my latest foray into the world of image
processing.

I have been active in tech space for 25 years now.

##  API

Photoveda has an API for most common image editing jobs like:

- Image adjustments
- Transformations
- Overlays
- Shapes 
- Filters
- Convert image format

##  Chrome Plugin

The original plan was to develop only the Chrome plugin. But I later
decided to go for other ways to use this tool since the market seems
right for it.

You can download the plugin and use it by installing from here.

##  Online edition

I found that several online tools exist in image processing that solve a
specific problem. Many AI tools abound but a comprehensive image editing
tool may work well.

People using API must get the same results as the browser edition. This
edition is meant for quick and dirty tasks.
